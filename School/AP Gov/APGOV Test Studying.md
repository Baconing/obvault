#### The Plan
1. Run a [practice test](https://knowt.com/exams/AP/AP-United-States-Government-and-Politics/practice-exam-room).
2. [Study](https://knowt.com/exams/AP/AP-United-States-Government-and-Politics). Any missed question should have a deep dive into it and the unit.
3. Run a [practice test](https://knowt.com/exams/AP/AP-United-States-Government-and-Politics/practice-exam-room)... [then FRQ's](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-united-states-government-and-politics/exam/ap-us-government-and-politics-past-exam-questions).
4. Pray I'm not too cooked.
5. If I am then we update this plan.
