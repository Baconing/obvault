Dissociation - when a chemical is dissolved in water and splits into its ions.

Acid = H+
Base = OH-
H + OH = $H_2O$ = neutral pH

pH of lakes ≈ 6-8
pH of lemon ≈ 3

\[] these brackets = concentration
find \[NaOH] = find concentration/molarity of NaOH

0.001M = 3pH (negative log of molarity)

Antacid = base

nutralization - acid and base react together

12M = concentrated solution

titration 
phenolpthalein - pH indicator

common antacid tables = calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate

1% disassociation is weak
100% is strong

vinegar - acetic acid, $HC_2H_3O_2$, ethanoic acid, 5% dissociation

all acids have hydrogen ions in them
all bases have hydroxide ions in them
