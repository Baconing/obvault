Dissociation - when a chemical is dissolved in water and splits into its ions.

Acid = $\ce{H+}$
Base = $\ce{OH-}$
$\ce{H+ + OH- -> H2O}$ = neutral pH

pH of lakes ≈ 6-8
pH of lemon ≈ 3

\[] = concentration
find $\ce{[NaOH]}$ = find concentration/molarity of $\ce{NaOH}$

0.001M = 3pH (negative log of molarity)

Antacid = base

neutralization - acid and base react together

12M = concentrated solution

titration - process used to find the concentration of an unknown solution 
phenolpthalein - pH indicator

common antacid tables = calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate

1% disassociation is weak
100% is strong

vinegar - acetic acid, $\ce{HC2H3O2}$, ethanoic acid, 5% dissociation

all acids have hydrogen ions in them
all bases have hydroxide ions in the
