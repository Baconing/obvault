## Health
Just like health in any other game
0 = death.
When any other stat reaches 0, it will passively damage you, the more stats at 0, the more damage done.

## Hunger
When it gets low, you can hear your stomach growl, can be used to unintentionally scare yourself.

## Energy
When it gets low you can see hallucinations.
